- The ride sharing market is deeply concentrated in urban cities. 86% of drivers are located in urban cities and two thirds of all rides
are in urban cities. This is not surprising since a lot of young people live in urban cities and they are more embracing of technology.

- Despite having more that three quarters of the drivers, urban cities bring in only 60% of revenues. This goes to show that despite the 
market being concentrated in urban cities, rural and suburban cities are an important source of revenue in this market.
